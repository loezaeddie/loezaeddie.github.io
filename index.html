    <p>Welcome to EDLO325.com take a seat and make yourself at home. I'm a student from PHS and I am currently enrolled in App Academy . My favorite class this year is U.S. History because we get to learn the origins of the U.S and how its economy grew and how it made an impact in the world. I also work with my dad on the weekends to rake leaves and mow lawns in other people's houses.</p>
